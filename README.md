# Workout Progress Tracker - Homework 15

## Description

This is a backend for a workout progress tracker application, utilizing mongoDB and mongoose.

Create and track daily workouts! Log multiple exercises for each workout in a given day and track workout name, type, weight, set, reps and duration of each exercise. If you log a cardio exercise, the distance will be tracked.

You can view the combined weight of multiple exercises and the total duration on the 'Stats' page -- for the last seven workouts.
